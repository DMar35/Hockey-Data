# Hockey-Data
Python Code to extract hockey player data from a rest API. This code uses links provided in the commented code and has a set of methods that range from extracting a players team, name, ID, etc, to specific stats from a specific season. 
This code then uses Pyodbc to get the extracted data from python to a SQL database, in this case, Microsoft SQL Server.
